# feedback-analysis-system

Synopsis:
Feedback analysis system intends to improve the performance of an organization. The historical feedback data would be analyzed and data mining 
would be done to determine the performance of an employee over the period of his working contract.

Motivation:
Although many institutes take feedback from their employees usually in written form or through a software system but there’s no culture to use this 
data in a positive way. There is no utilization of data for the betterment of an organization. The institutes have been getting the feedback data 
for years but they haven’t done any significant work on it. There is no platform to view that data that will help making decisions. Therefore, we 
decide to build a model of a system that can be fit to use for any organization to view the data they collect every year from their employees and 
visualize it to see the performance of their institute.
